# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

### Key Information

For this scenario, we have been provided information about the team/shareholders of the fictional company Cyclistic.

**Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

**Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

**Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.

**Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.

**Data:** The data used for this scenario has been sourced by [Motivate International Inc.](https://motivateco.com/) under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data used in this scenario can be accessed [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director

your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.
